Note: I'm still trying to figure out if I should take the interpretation or prediction route...but I'm thinking interpretation

Goal/question:
- The goal is to identify the features of Science Fiction movies that maximize revenue 
OR if I take the prediction route...the goal would be to predict profitability for an upcoming film
- In this scenario, a film production company that intends to produce a new Sci-Fi would benefit from
understanding how to make a film that brings in the highest profits (or from being able to understand how to budget based
on expected profits)

Data description:
- I plan to scrape data from box office mojo and imdb (I'm open to other reliable, web-scrapeable sites)
- I expect to work with the following features: revenue, director, actors, length of film, rating, writer, budget,
type of distribution, ... I need a couple more 


Tools: 
- I intend to use pandas, SQL, selenium, beautifulsoup, plotly (maybe seaborn?)

MVP Goal:
- To be honest, I'm not sure what the MVP would be. I don't see there being any final product that could suffice that
doesn't perform the overall task.
